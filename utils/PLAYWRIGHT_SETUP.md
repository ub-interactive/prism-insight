# Playwright Installation Guide

## 🎯 Installation for All Environments

PRISM-INSIGHT uses Playwright (Chromium browser) for PDF generation.

---

## 📦 Automatic Installation (Recommended)

The system will automatically attempt to download the browser on first run.

```bash
# Simply run - it will attempt automatic installation
python3 stock_analysis_orchestrator.py --mode afternoon
```

---

## 🔧 Manual Installation

If automatic installation fails, install manually:

### Method 1: Using Installation Script (Mac/Linux)

```bash
cd utils
chmod +x setup_playwright.sh
./setup_playwright.sh
```

### Method 2: Direct Commands

```bash
# Install Playwright package
pip install playwright

# Download Chromium browser
python3 -m playwright install chromium
```

### Method 3: With System Dependencies (Linux Server)

```bash
# Install Chromium with required system libraries
python3 -m playwright install --with-deps chromium
```

---

## 🐳 Docker Environment

In Docker, installation is **automatic**. No action required!

```bash
# Automatically installed during Docker build
docker-compose build

# Run container
docker-compose up -d
```

---

## 🖥️ Platform-Specific Installation

```

### Test PDF Conversion

    f.write('# Test Report\n\nThis is a test.')

markdown_to_pdf('test.md', 'test.pdf', method='playwright')
print('✅ PDF generation successful!')
```
